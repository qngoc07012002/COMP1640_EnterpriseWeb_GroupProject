            exceptional communication skills. Focused on customer needs and market demands, this Product Owner shapes
            the project's development direction and ensures that the final product meets all expectations and
            requirements.
            <br />
            <br /> In addition, the team comprises five developers with diverse and deep technical skills. Each member
            contributes to the development process by demonstrating dedication and expertise. They're not just
            outstanding developers but also excellent teammates, always ready to support each other and collaborate to
            overcome any challenges.
